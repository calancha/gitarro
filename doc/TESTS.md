# gitarro tests

## Unit tests

These tests run automatically on Travis for new [PRs](https://travis-ci.org/openSUSE/gitarro/pull_requests) or when a [special comment at a PR](ADVANCED.md#retriggering-a-specific-test) triggers them.

The tests will also run when a [branch changes](https://travis-ci.org/openSUSE/gitarro/branches), for example after a PR is merged

You must **always** run them locally before creating a PR or after you change your PR.

You can use the following command:

```console
rake test
```

## Acceptance tests

These tests use [rspec](http://rspec.info/) are not executed on travis, so you need to launch the execution manually.

**Run your tests always on your forked repo!**

### Syntax variables

You need a fixed PR open for running some tests.
REPO is the value of your forked repository.
PR_NUM is the PR of the fake repository on your forked repository (this is needed for testing).

### Syntax

```shell
 +repo=<REPO> pr_num=<PR_NUM> rspec -fd cmdline_spec.rb
```

Where `REPO` is your repository in format `project/repo` and `PR_NUM` is an opened and mergeable Pull Request.


### How to run them

#### Via rake (best way)

Then create a file called: `.rspec.yml`
And put your repository and PR_Number in yml file. (this file is ignored by git)
The Pr number is the fake repository on your forked repository.

```yaml
repo: MalloZup/gitarro
pr_num: 1
```

Then run the tests with
`rake spec`

#### Manually (using rspec)

For example:

```console
 cd tests/spec/
repo=MalloZup/gitarro pr_num=1 rspec -fd cmdline_spec.rb
```
